# Feed_ReaderTesting

This is the final Project for the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree where we have test the RSS Feeds website by using Jasmine, which is a Javascript testing framework.
The goal is to have all the test cases to pass without any kind of failures. WE will learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application.
These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

## Running the App

Download or clone this repository and run index.html.

## Tests Cases

These test cases are all in jasmine/spec/feedreader.js.
